![Fishing rod clipping icon](icon.png "Icon")

WEBFISHING mod to rotate fishing rods to help prevent some of the clipping issues. 
Rotation can be changed in-game or through the config file. 
The settings are based on the idle fishing animation:

- **X_rotation:** rotates fishing rod along rod axis.
- **Y_rotation:** rotates fishing rod left (positive) and right (negative).
- **Z_rotation:** rotates fishing rod up (negative) and down (positive).

Rotation is set when the fishing rod is equipped. To update rotation changes, reequip your fishing rod.
